# What is this?

- A beginner's attempt at translating Touhou lyrics with my current knowledge in the Japanese grammar. Other resources I use alongside to make these translation articles are mainly the [Touhou Wiki](https://en.touhouwiki.net/) and [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). Further reference points will be stated in individual articles.
- Raw translations are in `.md` and then ported to `.latex` after proofchecking.
- Finished articles are in `.pdf` formats and will be listed in the [Index](#index) section.
- Will be corrected along the way as I gain more knowledge on Japanese.
- **Disclaimer**: do note in mind this translation project is maintained whilst I learn Japanese from the square one (August 1st), not every part of the translation is bound to be exactly correct, as analyzing the sentences' structures and expanding vocabulary is prioritized. Context and literature representation is also the focal point of this translation project. I do however try to keep the translation as accurate as possible and convey the song's meaning and singer's intention correctly

- It is recommended to use a PDF Viewer instead of Github's built in PDF web view as there are embedded hyperlinks for references as well as audio tracks in the `sound/` folder. It is best that this repository is downloaded and to be viewed locally.
