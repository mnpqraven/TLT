{1} referencing the effects of the magical mallet --- a magical item that grants the user any wish they desire with an equally costly price, Seija's wish is to have the value and power of everything reversed, the strong becomes the weak and vice versa.

{2} retaliations from the other party, reaction to Seija's overturn. She takes it as compliments because insults seem to be an indicator of her successfully managed to riled up the order of power in Gensokyo
Creepy showtime: can be an analogy to the overturn of the weak(seija), as seija considers the this overturn and revolution a show or spectacle, and she's quite self aware of her specie-amanojaku to be lowlives and quite outlandish

{3}: a small insect as small as an inch has a soul that is half of that. It's a analogy to that every person no matter how big or small they are have their own willpower and guts, so never underestimate anyone. More here https://word-dictionary.jp/posts/1036

{4} this is sukuna talking, prolly right after seija has successfully tricked her

{5} wordplay on her being rockbottom will soon be strongest by the power of the magical mallet, and the strongest youkais in gensokyo will become the weakest because of the mallet.

{6} this is now seija's talking instead of seija. she's using keigo now, a complete opposite of her normal personality, portraying the duality and amanojaku's trickster habits

{7} sukuna learning in the temple/possibly having upbringing with loyalty

{8} I decided to have 'really' to be in different places in the sentences to portray the difference in uncertainty in seija's speech, first one being her carefree attitude before the effects of the magical mallet coming into play, second one displaying certainty in her character as she's set on the road of stealing the mallet/close to activating the mallet's power

Definitely the hardest one to crack because of the constant change of POV and also with the way seija referencing opposite sides along with the song's general topic/theme of duality. The lyrics this time is also riddled with katakata to emphasize parts of Seija's dialogue, which needs to be transformed into english with words with a more intense meaning, I thought about using weird capitalization but on second thought it wouldn't really make sense to the readers both contextually and aesthetically.

Note on Seija: Seija uses a *lot* of imperative due to her commanding manners after realizing she now wields the power and strength of the magical mallet, also due to her rotten personality and nature as a trickster/mischievous amanojaku.
